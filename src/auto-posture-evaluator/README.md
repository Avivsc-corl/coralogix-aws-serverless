# Snowbit CSPM/SSPM

This folder contains the code for the Snowbit's CSPM tool. This tool is responsible for actively testing the client's cloud platforms (e.g. AWS, GCP, Azure) and cloud services (e.g. Github, Slack, Office365, Gitlab) and will report any configuration that doesn't meet the common best practices or common classifications (such as ISO27001, HIPPA, PCI, etc)
